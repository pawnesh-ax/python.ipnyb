        "* The key difference between for and while loops in Python lies in their structure and use cases:\n",
        "1. for Loop Purpose: The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) for a specific number of times.\n",
        "* When to use: When you know the number of iterations in advance or you are iterating over a collection (like a list or range).\n",
        "* Control: The loop automatically handles the iteration, and you don't need to manually update the loop variable.\n",
        "2. while Loop Purpose: The while loop continues executing as long as the given condition is True.\n",
        "* When to use: When vou don't know beforehand how many iterations are needed and you want the loop to run until a condition is met.\n",
